							<h1 >The Past and Future of the Film Industry</h1>
							<p>The film industry has a long and rich history back to the late 19th century. It plays a significant role in the cultural and economic life of a society. Films are a medium of storytelling and entertainment, and they often reflect the values, beliefs, and experiences of the culture in which they are produced.

							<h2>Gender
							</h2>
							<p>Films often reflect and shape societal views on gender roles, identity, and expression. In the early days of cinema, women were often relegated to stereotypical roles, such as the dutiful wife or the damsel in distress, while men took on more active and heroic roles. However, as the film industry has evolved and become more diverse, so too have the representations of gender on screen. 
								In recent years, there has been an increased focus on diversity and representation in film, including representation of gender. This has led to the development of more inclusive and diverse storytelling in the film industry, and has helped to create a more nuanced and accurate portrayal of gender in film. 
								In the early stage, the friction of female actors shows a large fluctuating trend. In the later stage, the friction grew steadily. This trend corresponds to the ongoing feminist Movement. With the rise of feminism, female actors have more involvement in the female industry.
